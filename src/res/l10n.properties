PrivateGroupName=Private Group Name
СreatePrivateGroup=Create Private Group

CreateChatHelp0=\    All messages in private groups are encrypted by default. Group members are those who have a private key to decrypt messages. \
You can write to the group from any of your wallet addresses, including newly created ones, which destroys meta-information and connections. You can reply to the group:\n\
\    - from a personal address to a group address (all group members see your message);\n\
\    - from the group address to the group address (a completely anonymous message that does not require a reply);\n\
\    - from group address to personal address (everyone in the group will see to whom the message is addressed);\n\
\    - from personal address to personal address (private correspondence only between two members).\n\
\    So, you will have to create a new private key and distribute it to the members of the group, in order to connect them. When you create a group, \
a new group address will be generated and marked with the group name. \
This cannot be used for financial transactions since all members of the group will own this address!\n\
\    Enter the group name below and click "next".
CreateChatHelp1=\    Your address book now contains a group that you have created. You can use the group address or group name to filter messages related only to the group. \
To invite members to the group, copy the group's private key below and distribute it.\n\
\    The private key of a new group:


СonnectToPrivateGroup=Connect to Private Group
GroupPrivateKey=Group Private Key

ConnectChatHelp0=\    You are provided with a group private key. To join a group, you must enter a group name (any name you want) to easily identify messages from the group \
and the private key provided. The wallet will scan the blockchain for any missed messages from the group. You should wait for this process to finish!\n\
\    Enter the group name and private key in the appropriate fields below, then click "next" and wait for the blockchain scan to complete.

ChannelName=Channel Name
СreateChannel=Create Channel (Market)

CreateChannelHelp0=\    Channels have an owner and consist of two addresses:\n\
\    - The public channel address (beginning with "3");\n\
\    - The channel owner's personal address (forming for the public address).\n\
\    Only the channel owner can write to the channel, others (channel subscribers) can only read the channel and reply with private messages to the channel owner's \
personal address only. All messages in the channel are digitally signed with the owner's personal address, and no one can fake it by pretending to be the channel owner.\n\
\    So - you have to create a new public channel address and distribute it among your subscribers to connect to it. When you create a channel, you will also generate \
a new personal address for the channel owner, marked with the channel's name. It is allowed to use it for financial transactions, as only you will own the address!\n\
\    Enter the channel name below and click "next".
CreateChannelHelp1=\    Your address book now contains the created channel. You can use the channel address or its name to filter messages related only to the channel. \
The channel publishing interface will automatically select the channel owner's personal address to sign messages. To invite subscribers to the channel, copy the public \
address of the channel below and distribute it.\n\
\    The public address of the new channel:


ConnectToChannel=Subscribe to Channel (Market)
СhannelPublicAddress=Сhannel Public Address

ConnectChannelHelp0=\    You are given a public address for the channel. To subscribe to a channel, you must enter a channel name (any name you want) to easily identify \
messages from the channel and the public address provided. The wallet will scan the blockchain for any missed messages in the channel. You should wait for this process to finish!\n\
\    Enter the name of the channel, the public address in the appropriate fields below, then click "next" and wait for the blockchain scan to complete.

WalletPreventionHelp=\    Wallet preventive maintenance has 3 levels:\n\
\    1) Search for missed transactions by full scanning of the local blockchain (detects funds and messages you have access to);\n\
\    2) Cancellation of hung transactions not accepted for any reason by the pools (unfreezes funds originally frozen in such transactions);\n\
\    3) Full blockchain resynchronization (the longest operation associated with downloading the entire blockchain from the network, recommended \
for use only as a last resort)\n\

DonationHelp=\    There are no mobile wallets independent of external services and servers, capable of participating in network consensus and \
transaction distribution as full-fledged desktop wallets. We're working on such a wallet! We have the task to develop a LONG-coin core micro-node with \
fine scheduling of processes (so that the operation of the node is not visible to the battery), a sparing mode of mobile traffic usage, and prevention \
of metadata leakage to google services and the like. There are only a few people in the world capable of adequately solving this problem. You can speed up \
mobile wallet development by immodestly donating to our addresses. We guarantee that all funds will be spent on psychostimulants and vip-girls. \
Solving unprecedented challenges is an art - it's rock and roll 😉\n\
\    Our addresses are:

QuickReferenceHelp=\
\    - Use the "+" buttons in the address book to create your new addresses, save aliases of other people's p2p addresses, and import channel, marketplace, and \
private group addresses (simple address import is also available through the connection wizard). Right-clicking in the address book allows you to copy addresses \
and aliases to the clipboard. Double-clicking on an address alias allows you to change the alias or delete it;\n\
\    - Use PageUp/PageDown to quickly scroll through the transaction list. Clicking on the "Content" header allows you to set a transaction filter by alias, \
address, or transaction ID to separate the content you are interested in. Within content, CTRL+WHEEL allows you to scale the content for easy viewing. \
Right-clicking outside the content opens a menu of your contextual actions on the selected transaction. You can view the content of a transaction in a separate large window.\n\
\    - Launch the message editor by clicking on the "✉" button in the header of the transaction list, where you can use drag and drop to specify sender and recipient \
addresses, and if necessary, pin the message. Attention! Additional commission for a pinned message is specified in the tooltip on the "Pin Message" checkbox!\n\
\    - Running the editor through the context menu of the transaction list will substitute the addresses automatically from the data of the selected transaction. \
This is usually used for p2p messages! If you copy content from other sites, paste it in the message editor NOT formatted via CTRL+SHIFT+V and format it yourself \
to save commission.\n\
\    - The type of link you insert is recognized automatically by the extension at the end of the link. Use links only if you are sure of their longevity. \
It's better to create content embedded in the blockchain (it's designed for this purpose).\n\
\    - Before submitting content check how it looks in the message editor. And remember! Everything you post will stay here forever! \
Think three times before you hit the "Send" button ☺
