All content is on your conscience! It cannot be cancelled!


# Features

* Creation of channels and marketplaces;
* Creating private groups with encrypted messages;
* p2p messaging;

  (maximum duration of voice messages up to 1 minute);
* Placement of pinned banners in groups with a lifetime limit.
